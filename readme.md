<h4>Piping System Calculation</h4>

Octave scripts to calculate interaction between piping system and pump, by use of H-Q (Headloss - Flow) curves.</p>
<h5>What is <u>not</u> in here</h5>
It is <u>not</u> replacement for full fledged Hydraulic Flow Calculation program. </p>
Scripts are written as a tool which handles numbers correctly, I hope. Engineering conclusion and judgment are on you.</p>
<h5>What is in here</h5>
Few scripts which can speed up process of initial dimensioning pipelines in piping system. Usable (at least for me) for **preliminary** calculation.</p>
Scripts:</p>
1. eq_pump.m - calculates **equivalent pump** characterisitics. Just pump minus pressure losses in suction line;</p>
2. pipeloop.m - main calculation script, uses "flow.m" octave function file. Number of serial and parallel pipes is limited to 15 each</p>
3. pump.m - fitting pump curve with 2nd degree curve, given **minimum 3 points**. Original calculation script (and bit more) can be found [here](https://github.com/ddjokic/Pump-Calculation)</p>
4. Flow.m - function called by pipeloop script
As all is about curves, results are witten in "dxf" and "png" files.</p>
**dxf file** is needed as solution is graphical. Numerical solution can be obtained, but not subject of this excersise (yet).
<h5>You may need</h5>
Darcy-Weisbach pressure loss calculation in **single pipe**. My script can be found [here](https://github.com/ddjokic/Headloss-in-Pipe), together with few more infos. Or any other script, spreadsheet or means to get pipe Q-H Curve in form **H=A*Q^2+B**.
<h5>How to use?</h5>
Detailed workflow will be posted in near future. If interested, stay tuned.</p>
<h5>Limits</h5>
Scripts are limited to open piping systems (Loops/Subloops) of 30 pipes - 15 in parallel and 15 in serial, one pump and one suction pipe. There is a trick to handle more than 1 pump and 1 suction line - calculate equivalent pump(s) and feed results to appropriate section of "pipeloop" script.
Note that for both, serial and parallel pipes, subloops minimum 1 pipe is required. If you do not need them, just input A and B as '0' (zero).
<h5>Units</h5>
Scripts are calling for Flow expressed in cubic meters per hour [cum/h] and Headloss in meters [m]. Any other, consistent unit system will do. 
<h5>Edit Feb-2013</h5>
Added numerical solution, file "pipeloopnum.m" and output example files - png and dxf.</p>
Note that work is not finished and that scripts can return unexpected, even wrong, results.
